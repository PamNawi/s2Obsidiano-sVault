# Introduction
This is the repository for all the content generated by the guild s2Kawaii from the game [Ragnarok Mobile : Eternal Love](). Its common for us to generate some guides for our guild members. On the past this content was stored on our discord server and our google drive, but after some years we had to migrate and this cause us to lost a good chunk of our knowledge database that's why we are opting to have a repository made using [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) alongside the plugins [obsidian-dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) and [obsidian-digital-garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden), which respectively handle data manipulations and help turn the vault into a website. We created this based on the [icewind.quest](https://icewind.quest).


# Digital Obsidian Garden
This is the template to be used together with the [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden). 
See the README in the plugin repo for information on how to set it up.
